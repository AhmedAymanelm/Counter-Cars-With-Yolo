# Counter-Cars-With-Yolo
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to detect and count cars in real time from a video or camera feed. The system identifies each car as it passes through a defined area and keeps track of the total number of vehicles. It can be used for traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and road analysis.
